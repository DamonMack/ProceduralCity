## Description
The goal of this project was to recreate a program I found: [Shamus Young's Pixel City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d2-PtK4F6Y). I created my own data representation for three-dimensional buildings (explained in the video above) and rendered it into a navigable 3D scene using OpenGL and SDL2. Shaders for the program were also implemented from scratch using GLSL. There is still plenty of room for improvement, and as I have time in the future, I plan on adding more features, including higher graphical fidelity, more complex city organization, and an alternative data representation that allows for more unique buildings.

## Acknowledgements
- The project was create with support code provided in a course by Mike Shah from Northeastern. Several classes relating to the basic graphical engine were completed by me using code provided in various assignments.
- The GLM library is used to handle the linear-algebra-related math due to its close semantics to GLSL.
